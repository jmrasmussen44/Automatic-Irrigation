Irrigation system using a DS3231 or DS1307, 20x4 LCD with I2C interface, Water Sensor module, and 5 Push Buttons

Ensure you have the I2C to LCD library installed:  https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library

and the Real Time Clock library installed: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/rtclib/

(Optional) Lastly, I2CScanner to locate the Serial address for components: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/i2cscanner/



(Powered via 3.7v 1400mAh Lion Battery, which is connected to a type C charging module. 
From the charging module to an XL6009 DC-DC Booster Converter.


Connect components to Arduino as following:

XL6009 DC-DC Booster Converter @ 6v: VIN / GND

Water Sensor: Analog 0 

LCD & RTC: SDA, SCL pins (A4, A5 for Nano) with a 10K pull-up resistor on both. 

Push Buttons =>

		{
		Top Button: D2
		Middle Button: D3
		Bottom Button: D4
		Right Button: D5
		Left Button: D6
		}

IRF520 MOSFET (Water Pump): D8

IRF520 MOSFET (Vibration Motor): D9 

(Both Fets utilize 3.7v directly from the battery to power components)
